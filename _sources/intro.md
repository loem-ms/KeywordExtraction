# What is Keyword Extraction?

Keyword Extraction is a task of choosing keywords from a text/document. Here, keywords are words or sequences of one or more words which provide a compact describsion of a text’s content.

Keywords are widely use in information retrieval(IR) systems as they are simple to revise and remember. They can be used to enrich the presentation of search results as well.

# How to Extract Keywords?

Main processes in keyword extraction are:

* Generating candidate keywords

* Defining and Calculating scores of candidates

* Ranking cadidate keywords and sorting in descending order.

* Selecting top k candidates as the k keywords

There are many approaches in this extraction task due to Definitions of scores of cadidates and Calculation Methods. 
In next sections, we will introduce keyword extraction from single documents using statistical information (unsupervised learning) and keyword extraction with Machine learning/deep learning approach (supervised learning).
