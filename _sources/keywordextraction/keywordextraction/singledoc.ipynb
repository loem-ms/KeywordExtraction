At the location of\n\teach pixel only one color sample is taken, and the values of the other\n\tcolors must be interpolated using neighboring samples. This color plane\n\tinterpolation is known as demosaicing; it is one of the important tasks\n\tin a digital camera pipeline. If demosaicing is not performed\n\tappropriately, images suffer from highly visible color artifacts. In\n\tthis paper we present a new demosaicing technique that uses\n\tinter-channel correlation effectively in an alternating-projections\n\tscheme. We have compared this technique with six state-of-the-art\n\tdemosaicing techniques, and it outperforms all of them, both visually\n\tand in terms of mean square error\n\n\n\nkeywords:\n\ncolor plane interpolation\nalternating projections\ndigital cameras\ndemosaicing\ncolor filter arrays\ncolor artifacts\ninter-channel correlation\ncameras\ncorrelation methods\nimage colour analysis\ninterpolation\noptical filters\n\n"
